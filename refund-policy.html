            <h2>A legal disclaimer</h2>
            <p>At CPTFIT, we are committed to providing high-quality personal training, nutrition coaching, and lifestyle coaching services. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we strive to deliver value through every session and interaction.</p>

            <h4>1. General Policy</h4>
            <p>All payments must be made in full before services commence. By purchasing our services, you acknowledge and agree to the following refund terms.</p>

            <h4>2. No Refunds for Services Rendered</h4>
            <p>We do not offer refunds for services that have already been delivered, including attended sessions, completed coaching plans, or consumed content. This policy is in place to respect the time and resources allocated by our coaches and support staff.</p>

            <h4>3. Dissatisfaction or Service Concerns</h4>
            <p>If you are dissatisfied with the service you have received, we encourage you to contact us directly at <a href="mailto:car21@live.com.au">car21@live.com.au</a> or 0420586321 within 7 days of your concern. While we do not guarantee refunds, we are committed to resolving issues in good faith and may offer alternative solutions such as:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
              <li>Credit toward future sessions</li>
              <li>Service adjustments</li>
              <li>Coach reassignment, where appropriate</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Cancellations and Rescheduling</h4>
            <p>Clients must provide at least 24 hours' notice to cancel or reschedule a session. Failure to do so will result in the session being considered fulfilled and non-refundable.</p>

            <h4>5. Termination of Services</h4>
            <p>If you choose to terminate your services before the completion of your agreed package or program, please provide written notice. Refunds will not be issued for unused or remaining sessions, as your program spot and schedule have been reserved in advance.</p>

            <h4>6. Exceptional Circumstances</h4>
            <p>Refunds may be considered in rare, extenuating situations such as serious illness or injury, and must be supported by documentation. All such requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are subject to CPTFIT's discretion.</p>

            <h4>7. Legal Compliance</h4>
            <p>This policy aligns with the CPTFIT Terms and Conditions and complies with Australian Consumer Law under NSW jurisdiction.</p>
